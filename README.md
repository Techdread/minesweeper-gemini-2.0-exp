This is a simple Minesweeper game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

2. Select a difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert) or choose "Custom" to set your own grid size and mine count.
3. Left-click on a square to reveal it. If it's a mine, the game is over. If it's empty, it will show the number of adjacent mines.
4. Right-click on a square to place a flag if you suspect a mine. Right-click again to remove the flag.
